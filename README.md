Software Engineer Manager
-------------------------

People and technology person, problem-solving-oriented, always in self-development, and aiming to generate a positive impact through leadership roles in technology companies. I have **worked in startups for 12+ years** as a software engineer and in leadership positions, aiming to bridge the company’s goals and the team’s people, unifying all parties’ success.

My responsibilities as a manager in the last five years have been managing the people (hiring, retaining, developing), managing projects, using OKRs to plan the delivery cycles and KPIs to measure ongoing results, owning agile and governance rituals, and multiplying the organizational culture.

Technology speaking, I worked on several solutions, such as Payment and Shipping Integration, maintaining and refactoring legacy code, scaling and tweaking applications performance, and developing several features on technologies like Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Sidekiq, Elasticsearch, REST APIs and Tests (TDD, unit, integration).

Furthermore, I’m Brazilian, living in Florianópolis, married to my beautiful wife Bruna.
